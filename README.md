# WildTrack

An application used to track wild animals present around us and to report that data to the required authorities. Collect data from user using an app designed in flutter and backend built in firebase using some of the apis of google cloud. 

## Project Status
Currently the project is in its very starting stage. We want to make this app as robust as possible adding all the features necessary.

Users can upload the data just from their gallery and they are directed toward Map of Life website when they click wildlife around me button and they are directed toward Animal Protection Services of Saskatchewan page when they click the emergency button.
This is the very basic prototype that we developed during our 36 hours Hackathon EcoHack organised at University of Saskatchewan.

# WildTrack

An application used to track wild animals present around us and to report that data to the required authorities. Collect data from user using an app designed in flutter and backend built in firebase using some of the apis of google cloud. 

## Project Status
Currently the project is in its very starting stage. We want to make this app as robust as possible adding all the features necessary.

(only necessary if incomplete)

#### Example:

This project is currently in development. Users can upload the data just from their gallery and they are directed toward Map of Life website when they click wildlife around me button and they are directed toward Animal Protection Services of Saskatchewan page when they click the emergency button.
This is the very basic prototype that we developed during our 36 hours Hackathon EcoHack organised at University of Saskatchewan.

## Reflection

  - What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
  - What did you set out to build?
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
  - What were some unexpected obstacles?
  - What tools did you use to implement this project?
      - This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here.  

#### Example:  

This was a 3 week long project built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the Twitter API based on what they were interested in, such as 'most tagged users'. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-4.0` and `redux`.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication using Firebase or other third parties. Due to project time constraints, I had to table authentication and focus more on data visualization from parts of the API that weren't restricted to authenticated users.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, LoDash, D3, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.
